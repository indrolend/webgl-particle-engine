# Archived Demos

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - These demos are archived legacy code and are no longer maintained.

## About

This directory contains old demo files from previous versions of the WebGL Particle Engine. These files are kept for historical reference only and may not work correctly with the current codebase.

## Current Demos

For the latest, actively maintained demos, please use:

- **Main Demo**: [`/index.html`](../index.html) - Hybrid particle transition engine with image morphing
- **Blob Demo**: [`/blob-demo.html`](../blob-demo.html) - Organic blob mesh rendering with mitosis effects
- **Video Export Demo**: [`/export-hybrid-video.html`](../export-hybrid-video.html) - Record and export transitions as video

The following legacy demos are in this folder:

- `create-test-images.html` - Test image generation utility
- `debug.html` - Old debugging interface
- `disintegration-demo.html` - Legacy disintegration effect demo
- `image-morph-demo.html` - Old image morphing implementation
- `index-old.html` - Previous version of main page
- `minimal-example.html` - Basic usage example (outdated)
- `morph.html` / `morph-ui.js` - Legacy morphing UI
- `page-transition-demo.html` - Old page transition implementation
- `school-of-fish-demo.html` - Fish flocking behavior demo
- `simple-page-transition-demo.html` - Simplified transition demo
- `triangulation-demo.html` / `triangulation-demo.js` - Standalone triangulation demo

## Migration

If you need functionality from these archived demos, please refer to the current implementations in the main codebase which provide better performance, cleaner code, and active maintenance.
